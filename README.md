# TO-DO-APP
  The Project is to build a TODO-LIST app that allows users to create to-do lists and add tasks to those lists.The app allows users to store their lists and task in a database,which enable them to view and manage their lists.
  Each list in the app can contain multiple cards, which represent individual tasks or items. Users can add due dates, checklists, and labels to each card to help them organize and prioritize their tasks.
  To build this app, I used a combination of technologies,including a database management system like MongoDB,a backend framework like Express and EJS template engine.The app allows users to add To-Do Tasks by filling in a form that requires the user to enter the Task,Category and Due Date.Once the user has entered the details and clicked the “ADD TASK” button,it saves the data to the MongoDB database.We can observe the tasks that needed to be finished with deadline in MongoDB Compass.Once if the user has finished a specific task ,user can select the tasks and press “DELETE TASK”,then immediately the task will be deleted from the database.
